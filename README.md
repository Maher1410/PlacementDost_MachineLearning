# PlacementDost_MachineLearning Internship Tasks

Welcome to the repository containing the code for the tasks completed during the internship. This repository includes code for three tasks related to machine learning and natural language processing.


## Task 1: Detect Spam Emails

### Files:
- `Detect_Spam_Emails.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for detecting spam emails using LSTM neural networks.
- `Emails.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the spam email detection model.

### Description:
This task involves building a spam email detection model using deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM neural networks. The dataset consists of email text data labeled as spam or non-spam. The code includes data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and padding sequences. The LSTM model is constructed using TensorFlow Keras API, trained, and evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.


## Task 2: Analyze Customer Reviews

### Files:
- `Analyze_Customer_Reviews.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for sentiment analysis of customer reviews using natural language processing techniques.
- `Customer_Reviews.csv`: Dataset containing customer reviews for sentiment analysis.

### Description:
This task focuses on analyzing customer reviews to extract insights about customer sentiments. The code includes text preprocessing steps such as removing stopwords and punctuation, tokenization, and vectorization. Sentiment analysis is performed using machine learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive or negative. The code also includes visualization of word clouds to understand the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.


## Task 3: Parkinson's Disease Detection

### Files:
- `Parkinsons_Disease_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for detecting Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms.
- `Parkinsons_Disease.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the Parkinson's disease detection model.

### Description:
This task focuses on building a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease based on various voice features extracted from clinical recordings. The dataset contains features such as vocal fundamental frequency (MDVP:Fo), jitter, shimmer, and other acoustic properties. The code includes data preprocessing, model training using logistic regression, support vector machines, and XGBoost classifiers, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.
